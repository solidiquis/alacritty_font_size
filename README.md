# Alacritty Font Size
A cute terminal UI to quickly adjust font sizes for Alacritty.

## Installation

You can either download the script via the releases section, clone the repository, copy-paste the code like a degenerate milksop, or — if you're on Mac — install via Homebrew:

```
$ brew tap solidiquis/tap
$ brew install alacritty_font_size
```

I would most definitely recommend creating an alias for usage in the command line as the name is quite long.
