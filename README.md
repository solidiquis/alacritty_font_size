# Alacritty Font Size

![alacritty_font_size](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45523555/169672902-611e763b-f8cb-4438-93b0-67a8deb395c2.gif)

## Installation

You can either download the script via the releases section, clone the repository, copy-paste the code like a degenerate milksop, or — if you're on Mac — install via Homebrew:

```
$ brew tap solidiquis/tap
$ brew install alacritty_font_size
```

I would most definitely recommend creating an alias for usage in the command line as the name is quite long.

## Usage

- `<Up> | k` to increment font-size.
- `<Down> | j` to decrement font-size.

Exit with Ctrl-c.
